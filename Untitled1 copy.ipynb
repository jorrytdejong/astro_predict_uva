    "This Jupyter notebook aims to find a possible argument for the validity of astrology. This is done by retrieving the characteristics of a few hundred celebrities and assigning the right zodiac sign to them based on their characteristics. If the accuracy score is already higher than 1 divided by 12, it is not invalid to say that astrology might not be complete. Initially, I sought to generate the characteristics of the celebrities based on their Wikipedia pages and looping through them by retrieving the links of their Wikipedia pages via Sparkle. I only found out that a more concise summary of the life of a celebrity can be given by just inputting the right prompt in a language model. Since the language models that are now freely available on the market have been trained on billions of internet pages that are often covering celebrities, the information that comes out of the model is very accurate and with right prompting it can also be tweaked to represent more the characteristics of the celebrity rather than the activities and achievements that he or she has made."

    "The first step of building this code is by making some effective prompts. To receive the output from the language model that we want. The language model that is used is Mistral-7B. It is a relatively small model of around 4 GB that is allegedly better than the Facebook-made Lama model of even a bigger amount of parameters. Since it is quite expensive to run a language model for hours, not only because you pay for the usage of the language model, but also for the GPU that is needed for it. This model was attractive since it could just run on my M.2 chip of my MacBook and it still was generating the information that was needed to make this analysis."

When we ask a language model explicitly about the characteristics of person X, unavoidably the name of X will be used in the answer as well as activities and achievements that are exemplary and can be used to easily trace down the output to the inputted person. This will be bad for the purpose of this code since it might bias the outcome by already giving the right astrological sign in the output since there are many internet articles making astrological analysis about celebrities and we would miss the blindfoldedness of the code that we wish to have in order to see if we can really assign the right astrological sign to the celebrity with which we actually would predict the time frame in which a person is born by the sheer characteristics of him.

We import a few classes from the Language Chain Library for this and make connection with a local Mistral language model. One thing about the LengChain library is that it uses some specific method of combining multiple elements that are needed to create the output. And that is a method called chaining, where in an intuitive way the different elements are just put together on one line with a vertical dash between them. And it gets combined in a code that functions as a chain. This is called a wished effect."

Here comes the first difficulty of our approach and that is that if the web is stuffed with information that is mostly about actions and achievements and less about the internal qualities and deficiencies of the person described.

His focus on stability may cause him to prioritize maintaining the status quo over enacting meaningful change, which could be seen as uninspiring or stagnant by some members of the public. Furthermore, his tendency to avoid confrontation and compromise too easily might lead to missed opportunities for progress in certain areas.\n"

       "[[Document(page_content='5 THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE The Significance of the Concepts \\'Zodiac \\' and \\'Dierenriem \\' or \\'Tierkreis\\' All nature finds expression in cycles of becoming, being and dissolution, and the human race, as a part of nature, is inescapably involved in these cycles..\\n\\nThe metamorphosis observable in the course of a year here on earth appears to be symbolized in the succession of signs in the zodiac which, as we have already seen, no longer corresponds to the actual constellations as they appear in the heavens..\\n\\nThe interlocking band of the twelve signs is known in The Netherlands and Germany as the \\'dierenriem\\' or \\'Tierkreis\\' respectively..\\n\\nWe call it by the Greek word \\'zodiac\\' These words have an ait of mysticism about them..\\n\\nThus it is frequently stated that the meaning of the word \\'zodiac\\' is \\'path of life\\' The first time the term zodiac was put in writing in any form, so far as we can tell, was by Aristotle (who lived in the fQ!,lrth century BC)..\\n\\nHe spoke of a circle of animals (or, in a wider sense, \\'living creatures\\') and used the word \\'zooidion\\'..\\n\\nThe derivative, \\'zooidiakos\\' is found again later and usually as an adjective qualifying a noun such as \\'hodos\\' (= way) or \\'kuklos\\' (= circle); it seldom appears alone..\\n\\nSo \\'zodiac\\' means nothing more than circle of animals..\\n\\nIt is in the German-speaking areas, in particular, that the suggestion has gained currency that the German word for the zodiac, \\'Tierkreis\\' (which, like the cognate Dutch word, \\'dierenriem\\' seems also to mean no more than \\'circle of animals\\'), is really a corruption of Tyr-kreis..\\n\\nThe essential meaning of the rune Tyr is eternal change, from annihilation to rebirth..\\n\\nAs we learn from old North-German tradition, Tyr THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 85 was a son of the sun god, Wodan (or Odin), who was called The Reborn and made his appearance as the rejuvenated sun god after the self-offering of Wodan..\\n\\nThe story goes that Wodan hanged himself on a branch of the World Tree, Yggdrasil, and awoke from a nine-day trance, reborn as Tyr; so Tyr is the symbol of death and rebirth and hence the perpetual round of change and cycle of life..\\n\\nAccording to R.J. Gorsleben, the rune Tyr (t) also stands for the numerical value twelve..\\n\\n* Whether we look at it linguistically or historically, this explanation of \\'Tierkreis\\' as meaning \\'Tyr-kreis\\' (the \\U00100697ircle of Tyr) has scarcely any scientific value..\\n\\nNevertheless, although \\'the zodiac\\' and \\'der Tierkreis\\' seem to have no deeper significance as words, this does nothing to detract from the symbolism behind the names of the signs..\\n\\nThe deep symbolism behind the signs adopted from the astronomical constellations does justify us in treating the zodiac symbolically as a \\'path oflife\\' and in styling it as such..\\n\\nThis path of life is composed of our tweJve modern signs (anciently there were fewer) which correspond to stages of development in human lire and in nature as a whole..\\n\\nIn his Pulse of Life, Dane Rudhyar claims that the inner emotional and biological changes in human nature are very closely linked with the external changes in flora and fauna..\\n\\nThis was already felt by early man in his close contact with nature and is still relied on by various schools of astrology as evidential support..\\n\\nIt is generally agreed that astrology took its rise in the Northern Hemisphere; so it seems highly likely that nature\\'s phases of growth in this hemisphere have laid the foundations of the view of life held by the populations living there, who, building on their experiences, slowly constructed the astrological frame of reference that is still used today..\\n\\nAnd so the content of the concepts represented are as liable to development and change as is humanity itself, which is why the meaning contained in astrology has gained new dimensions and wears a different aspect from the one it had earlier..\\n\\nAstrology has the vitality ·to come to terms with the • There are twelve signs of course..\\n\\nTranslator\\'s note..\\n\\n86 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY latest trends in our day and age..\\n\\nNot only do the twelve signs of the zodiac represent twelve different character types ; more than this, they are symbols of certain energies in harmony with the \\'vibrations\\' belonging to various times of year..\\n\\nAssuming that the principle of synchronicity is true, these factors can be linked together..\\n\\nAs Carl Jung says, \\' ..\\n\\n..\\n\\n..\\n\\neverything born or done in this moment of time carries within it the quality of the moment..\\n\\n\\' When the sun occupies a certain sign at birth so that, in popular jargon, the native is said to \\'be\\' that sign, it does not mean that the native will necessarily display the characteristics of that sign; what it does mean is that, in the depths of his being, the individual concerned will experience the impulse to become conscious of his disposition and character while expressing them and developing them in accordance with the nature of the sign..\\n\\nSo then, the twelve signs of the zodiac lay down twelve different \\'paths of life\\', each of which has its constructive and its destructive side..\\n\\nHowever, it is certainly a mistake to talk of good and bad, difficult and easy signs in this connection..\\n\\nEach sign is essential to the whole chain, each sign logically proceeds from the one before it and forms a logical preparation for the one that follows..\\n\\nEvery sign has its own manner of expression, both in a higher and in a lower sense, and it depends on the person himself which options he will take and how he will use them..\\n\\nAll twelve signs of the zodiac can be found in each horoscope chart, from which fact we may infer that, in essence, each one of us has all the properties of the path of life within him..\\n\\nIt is t]le individual horoscope in which certain points are emphasized and this horoscope indicates which factors will play a role in the life of the individual and to what extent they will do so..\\n\\nIn itself, the fact that all signs (and all planets) are contained in the birth horoscope tells us that the twelve signs of the zodiac, irrespective of which of them holds the sun, symbolize archetypally the individual and the collective )if e process..\\n\\nThe twelve paths of life or, from another point of view, the twelve stages of growth, are i:iot peculiar to astrology..\\n\\nIf we take a close look at Christian tradition, we see that the twelve apostles are in some respects representative of twelve human THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 87 types..\\n\\nThe apostles have a marked resemblance to the signs of the zodiac..\\n\\nThe number twelve is also found in the twelve sons of Jacob, the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel..\\n\\nNor should we forget the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem as described in the Book of Revelation..\\n\\nAn important part.is played by the number twelve in other cultures too..\\n\\nThus Vedic lore has its twelve Adityas, or twelve aspects of the \\'God of the Solar Path\\', who manifest, in this cultural context, as twelve divine .beings with diverse properties..\\n\\nG.H ..\\n\\nMees says they are best interpreted as various stages along the spiritual path within the Vedic tradition and that then the parallel with astrology as studied in the West becomes clear..\\n\\nThe twelve labours of Hercules, and twelve \\'houses of the Aesir\\' in Germanic mythology, are representations of identical factors in the human collective unconscious..\\n\\nThey present themselves to us in different modes as archetypal ideas but, in essence, they are designations of the twelve stages of growth in nature and of the twelve paths of life in man..\\n\\nIn astrology they are enshrined in the twelve signs of the .zodiac..\\n\\nThe Sequence of the Signs Contained in the sequence of positive and negative signs is the series of cardinal, fixed and mutable crosses, which manifest in a fourfold way, analogous to the elements fire, earth, air and water..\\n\\nA combination of these quadruplicities and elements results in twelve different units which, as already explained i n Chapter 2 , are mutually exclusive..\\n\\nAlthough certain signs, e.g. those belonging to the same element, may display similarities, there is always an essential difference between one and another..\\n\\nAn exhaustive type description detailing all possible characteristics of each sign lies beyond the scope of this book..\\n\\nAdequate material of thi_s type is to be found in other books on astrology..\\n\\nHere we shall concentrate our attention on the sequence of the growth-stages and the directions taken by psychic energy seen in conjunction with the four different methods of orientation (or function types) ..\\n\\nIn this way we shall attempt to forge a link between ancient doctrine and modern psychology..\\n\\n88 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY Aries - the Ram Positive quadruplicity: cardinal Element: fire Day ruler: o Night ruler: E In the Aries phase, we see an awakening and the first step taken by the individual consciousness out of the undifferentiated ocean of the unconscious..\\n\\nThe \\'primal scream\\' and heat of the fire element are impulsive and direct..\\n\\nThe need to be always starting something new and to be a pioneer are clearly expressed by the fact that this cardinal sign is also a fire sign..\\n\\nThe sign of the Ram is the sign of the beginning and of the desire to press forward..\\n\\nIn nature, this outgoing impulse is visible in seed germination, which marks the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere..\\n\\nAs a fire sign, Aries belongs to the intuitive type, predominantly progressive psychic energy - creative and \\'ready for anything\\' Whether or not the Aries subject always finishes what he starts is another matter..\\n\\nThe powerful urge towards outward expression means that the Ram displays many of the characteristics of the psychological function of intuition..\\n\\nThere is a childishly impressionable and anticipatory attitude to life, always searching for new possibilities..\\n\\nAs soon as a situation has settled down into some form of regularity, it is suddenly seen as restricting because, in this stage, the freedom for unfettered manifestation and personal discovery is given priority..\\n\\nAn individual of the Ram type can become the-slave of his own craving for independence and liberty and that is something which, during the course of his life, he must learn to bring under control or to conquer..\\n\\nMost of his energies are devoted to the idea of emancipation, just as the seedling breaks out of the seed and strikes a path through the soil to the upper air to find a place of its own..\\n\\nIn much the same way, the Aries native slowly learns his limitations in the process of self-manifestation and of living in the sign of individualism..\\n\\nThis process usually runs a tempestuous course and he may expect to be told that he will never learn until he has burnt his fingers..\\n\\nNevertheless, the Aries phase is an essential part of human development..\\n\\nIt THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 89 i11volves living from inside to outside and, since it symbolizes \\' t he beginning\\', it marks the commencement of a voyage of srlf-discovery..\\n\\nThis developmental stage is one devoted to ,the «·xpression of self and for which reason the Ram type often rxhibits egotistic traits, showing little interest in the thoughts ;111d feelings of others..\\n\\nThe indifference is not deliberate, rather there is an inner compulsion towards selfdctermination..\\n\\nFor one of the Ram type all things are possible, since he has yet to encounter fixed structures and boundaries..\\n\\nConsequently, he is pre-eminently a fighter for the ideas welling up within him..\\n\\nHis audacity, activity and enthusiasm stand him in good stead, although they can degenerate into acerbity, violence and indiscretion..\\n\\nAs an essentially intuitive type, the Ram is far ahead of his time..\\n\\nHowever, the temptation to meddle and the longing to Kive expression to endless ideas can lose him the sympathy of others..\\n\\nThe compulsion to start many things can also reveal itself in the way someone of the Aries type will alter his opinion from one moment to the next and, with typical enthusiasm, adopt a standpoint diametrically opposed to his former one, defending the new with as much fire and verve as he had defended the old..\\n\\nHe is extremely inquisitive and much given to experiment, so that his interest in a project will often flag while he turns to something fresh..\\n\\nOn account of the fact that the Aries person has yet tv learn his limitations, and because he can recklessly play with fire without realizing it, he is capable of rushing headlong into all kinds of trouble..\\n\\nThe courage and daring ascribed to Aries are not so much a conscious determination to brave any danger as the effects of a primary life-impulse which sees no danger..\\n\\nIt is the possibilities within a dangerous situation that are seen, and this, combined with his lack of appreciation of his own limitations, makes an individual of the Aries type the intrepid pioneer par excellence and a leader who will stop at practically nothing..\\n\\nAmbition and the competitive spirit (he wants to be best in everything) arising from the discovery in early youth that he is the sort of individual who has to prove himself, are an added spur..\\n\\nPhysically, too, the Ram can have natural advantages; his recuperative powers are very great in all respects..\\n\\n90 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY In the Aries phase, man learns that he is an individual on this earth and, at the same time, by his setbacks and recoveries, he learns where his options and limitations lie..\\n\\nOnce he has come to terms with this phase, he can rejoice in a self-trust adequately based on his own inner r\\U001008bfsources and develop a large measure of integrity..\\n\\nWithout being too dogmatic about it, he can keep faith with a deep-felt conviction of his task in life and do what he has to do without fuss and bother..\\n\\nTaurus - the Bull

\\U00100395\\U00100398 In the Taurus development phase, a direction is imparted to the scattered impulses of Aries..\\n\\nA methodical and practical shaping occurs in order to create the secure basis which was obviously neither present nor necessary in the Aries phase..\\n\\nWe can see how important a part is played by the process of formation when we look at nature itself (especially in the month of May in the Northern Hemisphere)..\\n\\nSomewhat similarly, the human psyche in the Taurus phase is strongly inclined towards the formative side of life..\\n\\nSince it is a perceptive type, external forms and materials loom large in the life of this sign..\\n\\nThe world of ideas and ideals of the previous sign, Aries, is hardly, if at all, understood..\\n\\nIn the Taurus phase, the individuality is established and the boundaries circumscribing the individual possibilities are known and well-defined..\\n\\nThe subject knows his limitations..\\n\\nThe main theme in the new phase is the search for forms of secure existence for his individuality..\\n\\nJust as the Ram type identifies with his freedom and urge to do things, so the Bull type reaches self-consciousness in the first place by grasping at mainly material values..\\n\\nThis can express itself as a great desire to own everything thought to be of value and not necessarily as fluttering round one\\'s partner and friends and fussing over them..\\n\\nAnother possibility for expression is the use of material things for creative work..\\n\\nIn this way, although the world of material forms retains its importance, the individual develops from subordinating his THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 9 1 own craving for security on the material plane to subordinating matter to himself..\\n\\nAs a perceptive type within the fixed quadruplicity, man in this phase is capable of great tenacity and has an almost proverbial ability to settle down in practical and profitable affairs..\\n\\nThe inner-directed psychic energy enables prolonged retention of images, concepts and matter..\\n\\nSomeone of the Taurus type can, as a reliable and stabilizing factor, ensure t hat much is completed which others have given up in despair..\\n\\n( )n the other hand, the lack of flexibility in thought and in outlook on life, the pronounced tendency to keep to the safe path and to avoid new pathways as much as possible, and the wish to hold on to what he has, can turn him into a \\'bit of an old fossil\\' All this is obviously a reaction against the previous (Aries) phase, in which imprudence, a sense of adventure and initiative are the keywords..\\n\\nIn the Taurus phase, it is prudence, keeping to the known and passivity that are most in evidence..\\n\\nThe result is that after the Ram has long since left I he stage, the Bull is still there working out the implications of the Aries initiatives, giving them form, and..\\n\\nis putting the practical value of the Aries ideas to the test..\\n\\nIn the emotional sphere, too, the Bull represents a reaction to the Ram..\\n\\nThe Ram type is very quickly stimulated but disappointments are soon forgotten..\\n\\nFresh possibilities seem to stretch out endlessly in life..\\n\\nIn contrast to this, the Bull type\\'s reactions are much slower and he can dwell on his disappointments to the end of his days..\\n\\nTo the extent that the Ram can be unconsciously faithless so does the Bull stay consciously true, mainly on account of his need for security..\\n\\nSince his psyche is orientated in a perceptive manner, the Taurus type concentrates mainly on material pleasures whether sensual or purely artistic..\\n\\nNevertheless, the impulse must always come from outside and this may give an impression of laziness..\\n\\nAll the same, the Taurean native can work hard and long..\\n\\nThe retentiveness inherent in the fixed cross often comes over as a great sense of economy, which is closely connected with the pronounced need for security..\\n\\nThat is why the Taurean is in his element in practical callings..\\n\\nHe has a close liaison with matter and appreciates its value..\\n\\n92 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY Gemini - the Twins

\\U00100396\\U00100398 After the beginning phase of Aries has been translated into security and form in the phase of Taurus, a further reaction occurs in the phase of Gemini..\\n\\nFor example, Taurus is domesticated but Gemini takes little care of his home or is never in it..\\n\\nIn this stage, there is no longer any commitment to material objects..\\n\\nThere is, however, a compelling need to connect objects with one another or to form links between external objects which can be as varied as men and things and as facts and ideas..\\n\\nIn this phase, man steps for the first time outside the world of his individual possibilities and certitudes..\\n\\nThis first step outside takes Gemini into what, at first glance, looks like a disordered and disorganized world..\\n\\nOn this basis, we may explain the need first to relate things to what is known, then to find mutual relationships between things, and then bring them into some sort of order, as no more than a natural reaction to what is new..\\n\\nAs thinking is the function with which the Gemini type (an air type) finds its bearings in the world, the logical faculties come to the fore in all circumstances..\\n\\nThe personal confidence of someone of this type derives from an intellectual ability to dissect and arrange whatever is encountered, regardless of whether it is concrete or abstract..\\n\\nWith his manner of connected thinking, which is restless artd very mobile, an individual of the Gemini type can see all sides and so is the inventor of systems and techniques without, however, getting down to the fundamentals of what he meets on his pathway through life ..\\n\\nTaking into consideration that Gemini i s a positive sign, we can see that the direction taken by the psychic energy (which can be just as easily progressive as regressive) has an outwardgoing, progressive tendency, so that the mobility makes its appearance quite noticeably..\\n\\nThe same mobility is found once more in the contacts made by someone of the Twins type..\\n\\nHe requires many contacts for the formation and development of bis character, though not necessarily of the deep friendship variety..\\n\\nTHE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 93 Mobility takes a positive direction and gives to this type a l\\'crtain degree of vivacity, versatility and changeableness, which can prove very useful to its members professionally if they go in for work involving the communication of either thoughts or things - say in journalism or trade..\\n\\nThe inconstancy observed here, in emotions, ideas and occupations, is a reaction to the Taurus phase..\\n\\nThe tendency to be impersonal makes someone of this type step lightheartedly over things of value to which the Bull with all his jealousy and possessiveness would hold tight..\\n\\nAt the same time, this is the first stage in which man is conscious of his position vis-a-vis the outside world, and that is where the duality of the Twins comes in..\\n\\nThe outer world arouses his curiosity and captures his attention, but the multiplicity of things, all of which appear to have equal importance, leads him to skip from one subject to another..\\n\\nHis concentration is easily broken and he seldom finds an opportunity to develop his thoughts..\\n\\nAnalogous to the multifarious unfolding of nature in the flowering of the year, there are _the great many sides of Gemini type..\\n\\nThe many-sidedness and changeableness impart to this type enormous adaptability but bring with them the dangers of superficiality and dilettantism..\\n\\nBut once again the duality of this type comes to the fore in its adaptability..\\n\\nThe individual watches himself facing the universe and his adjustment to the outside switches to an inner adj ustment..\\n\\nThe neutral stance and the need to bring order and m ake connections flow in essence from inner uncertainty as to the individual\\'s place in the world..\\n\\nSo much attention is paid to the outside world and so much interest is bestowed upon it that the inner world is left in a state of considerable passivity - values are sought in the immediate environment..\\n\\nSo, in this phase of development, man must learn the lesson that he has to be himself and to have the courage of his opinions without hiding behind impersonal mental constructs derived from the world outside..\\n\\nMental perception of the universe is the keynote of the Gemini phase..\\n\\n94 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY Cancer - the Crab Negative quadruplicity: cardinal Element: water Ruler: :» In the phase of Cancer the apex of the first part of the growth process of man is reached..\\n\\nAfter the initial action (Aries) and consolidation (Taurus) and the setting up of a relationship with the outside world (Gemini), we have the influence of the outer on the inner in the form of impressions and feelings..\\n\\nThe element water, which corresponds to the psychological function of feeling, alerts us by its attribution to the sign Cancer that personal growth will proceed by way of inner experience..\\n\\nIn spite of the fact that Cancer is one of the cardinal signs, which indicates an outward flowing energy, this cardinal-sign aspect is not so obvious because Cancer already belongs to the negative, inward-looking signs..\\n\\nThis intimates the presence of a degree of duality in the emotional life of the Cancer type, so that, while there is great selfinvolvement with a great deal being experienced internally and in silence, an equally powerful involvement is felt in what is going on outside..\\n\\nThe Crab literally is \\'much attracted\\' and is attractive in turn..\\n\\nThe fact that the Crab native does not in principle like to make himself conspicuous, and prefers to live in his own domestic and emotional privacy, means that he can well be the driving fore\\U00100698b ehind someone else..\\n\\nIt is in this way that the cardinal cross impulse to force the pace in the outside world is often manifested..\\n\\nOn the one hand, the immediate circle may resent this meddling with their affairs but, on the other hand, the participation of the Cancer individual may prove stimulating..\\n\\nHis wealth of emotions and his inclination to assimilate impressions from the outer world via his feelings means that someone of the Cancer type has a great need of emotion, intimate experiences and of petting and pampering..\\n\\nBy way of reaction to Gemini, which is so much involved in the world and so little involved in itself, Cancer takes for its main sphere of activity the home and domestic affairs together with the family and tradition..\\n\\nFamily and parenthood are tremendously important to this type, which thus presents a THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 95 parallel to the fruiting season in nature..\\n\\nThe emotional side of the Cancer character is hard to put 111to words..\\n\\nIt reveals itself in great imagination, sensibility ,111d attachment, and the Cancer subject has no difficulty in l\\'Xpressing his feelings in artistic productions..\\n\\nAs a water sign, < !ancer is very active internally even though considerable passivity is displayed towards the outside..\\n\\nThis can show itself .,s affection, friendliness, openness to impressions and ;1menableness, though also as despondency, self-indulgence ,111d self-pity..\\n\\nOwing to his great sensitivity, what is said and < lone by others is often taken the wrong way..\\n\\nHis feelings are not only the spectacles through which the < !ancer individual looks but also the tool he must learn to handle..\\n\\nIn human development, the Crab phase means that c·motions aroused by the environment have to be assimilated and that the inner, emotional side of life has to be recognized and understood, because man cannot function perfectly without it..\\n\\nIn this, the first of the water signs, an overcompensation for the vulnerability of the feelings is often seen in the shape of an ostentatious display of feelings and emotions..\\n\\nThe insecurity c\\U00100699ntailed in this vulnerability is overcompensated for by fits of pique and, in extreme cases, by staging pathetic scenes..\\n\\nThe reactions of those around can then act as a pleasing stimulus and the individual can easily be tempted to start \\'doing it for kicks\\'..\\n\\nPossessiveness towards relatives and children is also a result of this insecurity; the fear of losing the external forms that satisfy the need for emotional experiences brings out the caring, cherishing and mothering side of the Cancer type..\\n\\nThe changing moods to which the Cancer type is liable may also be attributed to this insecurity..\\n\\nWhen, in the Cancer phase, man has come to an understanding acceptance of his own feelings, he is ready for the next cycle of the elements, starting with the fire again in the phase of Leo..\\n\\n96 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY Leo - the Lion Positive quadruplicity: fixed Element: fire Ruler: 0 In the first four phases, we saw how different sides of the individuality were developed..\\n\\nThe possibilities and limitations of the individuality were explored and established..\\n\\nThen the outer world was investigated and it was allowed to work on the inner nature in the form of emotions and feelings..\\n\\nIn the next phase, we have an individual personality which is conscious of itself..\\n\\nIn the phase of Leo, the leading theme is the \\'dramatic\\' presentation of the personality as a means of gaining recognition..\\n\\nIn this phase, the individual has become sure of his identity yet is still very unsure of himself in the social arena..\\n\\nConsequently, by making himself out to be someone big, he tries to ensure for himself the place in society to which he is only entitled in his imagination..\\n\\nAfter the formation of the personality in the first four signs, the renewed series of elements has to do with the social behaviour of the personality and chiefly with its further cultivation..\\n\\nThe first step in this direction is taken in the phase of the Lion..\\n\\nThe developed selfconsciousness, which is much more \\'conscious\\' than is that of the Ram (self-consciousness is a trait of the intuitive types and signs), is strongly turned in on the self..\\n\\nLeo belongs to the fixed cross and so the psychic energy has a pronounced inward flow..\\n\\nHere is an explanation of the fact that, although Leo is one of the positive signs and is also a fire sign, the Leo type makes an impression of great stability ; it does not run out of steam as quickly as the Aries type tends to do and is much better placed to finish what it starts..\\n\\nThe self-involvement of the fixed cross, in combination with the strong self-expression common to fire signs, explains the great need (though not absolute necessity) experienced by Leo to be the centre of attention..\\n\\nAbove all he feels himself to be a born leader of authority..\\n\\nThus the Leo type is eminently suitable as a director, chairman or the like, positives which mean a lot to him because they can bring the social recognition that confirms his sense of personal worth..\\n\\nTHE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 97 With his intuitive orientation, Leo is often well ahead of his 1 ime, even though he is particularly good at fitting in with 1 11rrent trends; he attaches great importance to a role in social life in the widest sense of the world..\\n\\nSince his energy is d irected inwards, he is usually saved from the ruptures in rdationships commonly the result of the impulsiveness pl\\'culiar to the fire signs..\\n\\nOwing to his social uncertainty, someone of the Leo type l\\'an overcompensate by taking the attitude that, come what may, he will be the centre of attention and, in doing so, stir up ; 1 great deal of opposition..\\n\\nSweeping gestures, ostentatious i•·wellery and luxury living serve to underline the situation..\\n\\nWhenever a power complex develops in this way, the things mentioned can end in tyranny, stubbornness, passionate behaviour and haughtiness..\\n\\nOn the other hand, Leo\\'s great stability can produce resoluteness and valour and make him r:hivalrous, magnanimous, sympathetic and idealistic..\\n\\nIn the Leo phase, we observe that after his personality has I >een formed man sets to work on himself..\\n\\nHobbies and other forms of creative self-expression are taken up at this stage..\\n\\nIn nature, the fruit is ripe and ready for picking; cropping can begin..\\n\\nSurface ripeness is found in the sign Leo, which is analogous to the heat of summer..\\n\\nHowever, in human development, inner ripeness comes in winter..\\n\\nThe intensity with which someone of the Leo type is aware of his own personality and the resulting pride and will-power with which he meets life can give him the feeling that he has much to offer - a feeling that can produce great liberality..\\n\\nIn return for his gifts, the Leo type expects a certain amount of devotion and appreciation..\\n\\nIn this stage of development, man runs the risk of becoming the victim of his ideals and illusions while intoxicated with self-experience, because in this state he fails to see that hankering after and dreaming of social acceptance subtly separates him from his ideal..\\n\\nThe bold approach to what lies outside is a reaction to the stay-at-home Crab, although the Lion can be domestic too, just so long as he can turn his house into a centre where friends and acquaintances can meet and where he can satisfy his hankering for pleasure, games and amusement and give full rein to his creativity..\\n\\n98 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY Virgo - the Virgin

\\U0010027d\\U00100398 nr The Virgo phase 1s both a consequence of and a reaction against the high point of the Leo phase, in which selfconsciousness, self-expression and concentration on broad issues were the main themes..\\n\\nIn the present phase, discrimination is developed, based on the critical analysis of the consequences of actions and transactions such as come to the fore in the Leo phase..\\n\\nEven the fiery emotions and passions of the Leo native are subjected to a critical analysis in the phase of the Virgin, so that this sign makes an impression of coldness..\\n\\nThis is actually a reaction against the display of self-assurance in the Leo phase..\\n\\nIn the Virgo phase, man feels his own vulnerability and learns to see his own faults, so selfcriticism is an important factor at this stage..\\n\\nHis own motives and desires are subjected to constant analysis, so that the Virgo type is difficult to handle..\\n\\nAs a negative sign, Virgo turns inwards, and yet the psychic energy is fairly freeflowing..\\n\\nAs a mutable sign, the Virgin presumably conceals considerable liveliness behind her mask of coldness, but her spritely mind finds it difficult to express itself in the outside world..\\n\\nIn the phase of this, the second earth sign, the phenomenal world is approached with the function of perception Gust as it is in the Taurus phase) ; the individual is preoccupied with tangible reality and prefers to deal with concrete and material things..\\n\\nHowever, in this phase, attention is not devoted to the acquisition of whatever offers security, as was true of the Taurus phase, but to gaining an insight into the diversity of forms and motives..\\n\\nThe mobility of the psychic energy introduces a measure of uncertainty into some sides of the personality, and so the Virgo type is kept busy making a critical evaluation of her personality with a view to devaluing herself so to speak, much as the Gemini type, the first of the mutable signs, is always playing down his own opinions in his eagerness to snatch at the latest idea..\\n\\nThis self-depreciation holds the reason for the modesty (or fear of being noticed) and THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 99 shyness of the Virgin (whereas the stir and bustle of Gemini tend to attract attention)..\\n\\nVirgo\\'s perceptiveness makes her very fond of comfort, good clothes, fine and healthy food etc..\\n\\nWhat is more, with her practicality and the detailed way in which she looks at the world, she is a good planner; nothing escapes her attention and she has a strongly-developed sense of proportion..\\n\\nThe ability to analyse plus lively thinking fit this type of practical and detailed scientific research gi_ving rise to the kind of researcher who can spend much of life on a very specialized project in quiet seclusion ( due to the negative side of the sign!)..\\n\\nA methodical approach, desire of knowledge, orderliness, acumen and sobriety are virtues which assist the Virgo type in this work..\\n\\nThe reaping commenced under Leo reaches full harvest in Virgo, a harvest culled from the growing insight into motivations..\\n\\nThere is a close connection here with the subservience ascribed to the sign of Virgo..\\n\\nOn account of the difficulty experienced in dealing with affairs, the Virgoan works best in a subordinate position, but, in trying to achieve self-understanding, the ability has been gained to show understanding to others..\\n\\nWhen further differentiated, this type is in a position to serve humanity without at the same time thinking of self or personal advantage..\\n\\nThe perfection that Virgo looks for in herself is also sought in others and perhaps this is one reason why so many unmarried people come under this type..\\n\\nHer very cold, aloof and unemotional behaviour enables someone of the Virgo type to analyse and categorize facts in an extremely objective and intellectual manner; the findings are then handed out to others in a rather pedantic fashion..\\n\\nVirgo\\'s purity and craving for perfection have much to do with the feeling of uncertainty which, in another respect, is the driving force behind the urge to analyse..\\n\\nThe hypersensitive \\'don\\'t-touch-me\\' attitude in love affairs, however, is as much a matter of fastidiousness as of insecurity..\\n\\nYet if insecurity does play too big a part in affairs of the heart, refuge can be taken in overcompensation..\\n\\nIn that case either too much is demanded of the partner (who must be ideal) or else the Virgo individual lapses into out-of-character behaviour..\\n\\nNeedless to 1 00 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY say, chastity is no longer evident in the last instance..\\n\\nEven then, Virgo is not deserted by her critical faculties, however..\\n\\nThe Virgo phase is the phase of self-criticism and selfperfection, although less developed Virgoans certainly do not take kindly to critical remarks..\\n\\nThis is the consequence of a keenly felt inner vulnerability..\\n\\nIn the Virgo phase, this vulnerability is submitted to a searching examination with a view to preparing for participation, initially with a partner (the phase of Balance), in the greater whole..\\n\\nIntrospection and refining are central to the development phase of the Virgin..\\n\\nLibra - the Balance Positive quadruplicity: cardinal Element: air Ruler: \\U001000df One of the turning-points in human development, as expressed in the phase of Libra, is associating with others, and in particular a partner, on an equal footing..\\n\\nThe phase of critical analysis (and of self-criticism) has run its course in Virgo and will now be put to good use..\\n\\nContrasts in general come into prominence and the Libra type spares no pains in striking a balance between any items which appear to be conflicting or out of equilibrium - hence the symbol of the __ Balance..\\n\\nThe sign of Libra marks the beginning of autumn, which initiates a balance in nature with the falling of the leaves for the formation of fresh humus to replenish the soil depleted by the year\\'s growth..\\n\\nThus the ground is laid for another spring, just as the Balance phase in man prepares the way for a more complete development through relationships with others, by becoming aware of his own shadow side and even getting to know his own inner partner (which C .G..\\n\\nJung named the Anima for the man and the Animus for the woman..\\n\\nSee also Chapter 6)..\\n\\nIn this way, man can reach deeper into himself and contemplate what lies within..\\n\\nThis process corresponds to the autumnal period in nature when outer things gradually decay and life returns to the bosom of the earth..\\n\\nThe sign of Libra stands opposite the sign of Aries, that first THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 1 0 1 beginning of the individual when man puts himself in the centre..\\n\\nIn the Libra phase, \\'the other\\' is put in the centre and so it is appropriate that it faces the Aries phase - externally anyway..\\n\\nIn the Aries phase, growth was internal because the individual took everything on himself; in the Libra phase, Krowth takes place externally since everytJ:iing is related to the opposite number and to the part played by the opposite number in the individual\\'s life..\\n\\nWhat this really refers to, however, is man\\'s relationship with his own inalienable unconscious and it is this that is reflected in the other person..\\n\\nThis is a completely new type of experience and it is approached mainly intellectually by the Libra subject, the clement air being, as we have said, analogous to the psychological function of thinking..\\n\\nThe Libra type will have much to learn emotionally from this first, essential confrontation with another, a confrontation which this type goes to meet cheerfully, however, in keeping with the positive direction taken by the energy of the cardinal cross..\\n\\nA socially conscious relationship with others is important and the Libra subject strives for relationships which are as perfect as possible, and people and situations are compared with and judged by this standard of perfection..\\n\\nThis is the stage at which the standards are set and which we shall be expected to abide by in our relationships and social intercourse with others..\\n\\nIn this way each can be accorded the recognition and respect due to him on the grounds of his individuality..\\n\\nIt is by communication and association with others that our conscious place is objectified..\\n\\nA person of the Libra types greets social experience with open arms; he has an interest in psychology and in human relations..\\n\\nIn his new contacts, he looks above all for fresh knowledge and information to stimulate him mentally - a reaction against the Virgo phase, in which the individual has been putting himself under the microscope, making it imperative for him to turn now to something new outside himself..\\n\\nAnd so, the person has become an individual who experiences and accepts himself as such; he is not so much concerned with simply functioning in society as in making his individual contribution to it..\\n\\nBecause he; thinks objectively, someone of the Libra type can easily put himself in the place of others..\\n\\nOn the one hand, 102 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY this makes him a good diplomat, but, on the other hand, because he sees and understands all points of view, he is quite capable of taking hard decisions or, in another context, is too ready to compromise..\\n\\nHe would make an impartial judge, but might find it hard to reach a decision..\\n\\nIrresolution is a characteristic that is part and parcel of the weighing operations of the Balance..\\n\\nThe cause here is completely different from that prompting the vacillation of Virgo..\\n\\nIn Libra, the hesitation has an intellectual origin, whereas in Virgo it is due to inner uncertainty..\\n\\nSince the thinking is strongly emphasized and the feeling function is consequently little developed in the first instance, the Libra type is quickly thrown off balance emotionally and fickleness and uncertainty can arise..\\n\\nIn the Libra phase, the search for harmony is not so much a native gift as a need supported by such qualities as willingness, friendliness, a degree of enthusiasm and a feeling for aesthetics..\\n\\nAny sentimentality, superficiality and fickleness always emphasize a lack of balance and the incentive for its restoration..\\n\\nFollowing the introspection of the Virgo phase comes the intense involvement of Libra with the outer world, which is, however, an involvement with the external form - to which the next sign offers a strong reaction..\\n\\n/ Scorpio - the Scorpion Negative quadruplicity: fixed Element: water Day ruler: e Night ruler: o After the phase of mainly mental contact on the basis of individuality in the period of the Balance, Scorpio ushers in the phase of emotional experience and of an experiential study of the Libran contacts..\\n\\nThe Scorpio phase enables one to experience that making contacts and maintaining relationships are not the be-all and end-all of life and that outward harmony with others is no goal in itself..\\n\\nThat is why Scorpio will try to penetrate to the deeper significance of life on earth and to the meaning of human life..\\n\\nTransformation processes at every level in the human psyche are indissolubly THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LI FE 1 03 l ,ound up with the Scorpio phase..\\n\\nThese transformation processes more or less entail that in penetrating the secrets of 1 hc human psyche much of personal value must be jettisoned if it is not to inhibit further growth..\\n\\nIn the phase of the Scorpion, autumn is in full swing ; the lush external forms have died back to..\\n\\nleave nothing but bare I rces and bushes above the exhausted earth, and the latter is a l\\'arcass from which life can flourish anew..\\n\\nThis death in nature is analogous to the crisis suffered by man in the Scorpion phase..\\n\\nHuman relationships are expanded and deepened in the form of complete surrender, for example sexually, and in a total use and consumption of self and of the other person - an all-or-nothing approach..\\n\\nThe sign is a fixed one and this is an indication here of the tenacity of the sign of the Scorpion; its natives will go to any extreme to retain what they value or what they look on as their ideal..\\n\\nIn this respect, the sign shows agreement with the opposite sign, Taurus, which is also very retentive..\\n\\nHowever, the behaviour of the Scorpio subject is governed not by the desire for material security but by his intense emotional needs..\\n\\nFor the water signs, feelings and emotions are the appointed vehicles for growth..\\n\\nIn combination with the inner-directed energy of the fixed cross, these feelings and emotions arising from relationships with others are strongly intensified, although this may not be obvious..\\n\\nThe element water is introvert and the fixed cross itself is inward looking..\\n\\nThe Scorpio subject, therefore, is reserved and inscrutable and both stubborn and passionate..\\n\\nHis pronounced inward bias gives him a strong will and great inner strength..\\n\\nPeople of this type cling so tenaciously to the things they value that they are prepared, if necessary, to pay for them with their lives..\\n\\nPenetration to the centre of everything and, in particular, to the centre of oneself is the leading theme of the Scorpio type and Scorpio individuals have an unfailing ability to spot the weak points of others..\\n\\nTheir uncommunicativeness, their outer control of their feelings, their intense emotional involvement and the way they \\'dig deep \\' prevent them from always being understood or appreciated properly by those around them..\\n\\nMany scarcely suspect what is going on underneath the placid exterior of someone of the Scorpio type..\\n\\n1 04 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY The depth demanded of one\\'s opposite number in the Scorpion phase means that people at this stage of development become conscious of the partner-image inside them: the Anima or female image in the man and the Animus or male image in the woman..\\n\\nThe deep emotional experience of being reflected in some0ne of the opposite sex makes it possible to reach down in one\\'s own psyche to its hidden hopes and wishes and to its buried complexes..\\n\\nIn contrast to the mental reaction to the partne1 seen in Libra, the reaction here is emotional, so that a great deal of unconscious material is brought to light..\\n\\nHence this phase can become one of the really big crises in life and yet, at the same time, one of the most creative and satisfying periods..\\n\\nIn this phase, man is faced with a choice as to whether or not to wallow in his emotions..\\n\\nIf he does so, he belongs to what may be called the \\'lower\\' Scorpio type, a type which through its strong emotionality and sexuality and its great tenacity in relationships with others often exhibits a strong possessiveness..\\n\\nThe result is often jealous and even violent behaviour or else, where the individual nurses what is felt to be a grievance, his violent feelings are channelled into longlasting hate..\\n\\nBut the individual who does undergo a transformation process in this phase can develop into a \\'higher\\' type, symbolized by the eagle, which can penetrate the secrets of nature quite unselfishly and can delve into the hidden and mysterious on the strength of a feeling which, in a crisis, is transformed from a personal emotional reaction into a precision instrument of pure feeling and sympathy..\\n\\nSagittarius - the Archer Positive quadruplicity: mutable Element: fire Day ruler: 1(..\\n\\nNight ruler: W -I During nature\\'s long winter sleep, after the deep enquiry in the phase of the Scorpion, we come to the phase of the Archer, which begins by forming a relationship between external phenomena and the internal experiences known to Scorpio..\\n\\nNo longer is the atter,1pt made to fathom the \\'whys and wherefores\\' of things by means of the feelings alone; the search THE ZODIAC AS A PA TH OF LIFE 105 is now made with an abstract spirit too and is aimed at reaching a synthesis..\\n\\nThe discriminatory thinking that was characteristic of the previous phases, in which a person\\'s own individuality has been clearly marked out from all others in order to realize his own character the better, now overflows into the need to enjoy something more universal or to discover universal principles..\\n\\nAs a fire sign, Sagittarius is mainly involved in intuitive thinking..\\n\\nThe empathy with and appreciation of the wider relationships lying behind the facts sets this phase of the Archer within a bigger framework in which, however, the emotional factor is less than in the preceding phase..\\n\\nThe mutability of the psychic energy indicates that the Archer turns both outwards and inwards at various times, although the impulses which move outward have the upper hand generally speaking, owing to the fact that fire signs are strongly orientated towards the outside world..\\n\\nIn this the Sagittarius native is very like Gemini..\\n\\nHowever, for Gemini the most important thing was the initial _contact with the outside world and the task of bringing order to all kinds of things, whereas in the Sagittarius phase, essential importance is attached to placing these facts and things in a philosophical or religious framework so as to be able to participate in a wider social whole..\\n\\nThe search into the background lying behind appearances carried out in the Scorpio phase is extended in the Sagittarius phase into a search for truth, and the fiery nature of the sign gives a clear indication of the readiness of the Sagittarian to defend his discovered truth with fire and sword, which is why any tact and subtlety are conspicuous by their absence..\\n\\nThe idealism of the fire signs may lead in Sagittarius to fanaticism in religion or in some theory of life..\\n\\nBecause, in the Sagittarius phase, a start has just been made on arriving at a philosophy of life, the need is felt to become a propagandist..\\n\\nThe individual can find a great satisfaction in announcing his newfound truth to others, because this reduces any inner uncertainty he may have..\\n\\nTeaching a doctrine then, is a way for Sagittarius to strengthen his own spiritual basis..\\n\\nThe mutability of the psychic energy in such an outgoing sign as Sagittarius produces a great urge for freedom and travel..\\n\\nAfter the crisis of the Scorpion phase, the limits of the 1 06 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY personal are transcended for the first time..\\n\\nFor the Sagittarian, the urge to travel in the sense of crossing boundaries can express itself in concrete fashion in visits to foreign lands and regions or, more abstractly as the study of cultures and philosophies of life..\\n\\nThis might be called the search for new inner terrain..\\n\\nAs an intuitive type, Sagittarius always runs the risk of overlooking the personal side of life due to attaching major importance to spiritual laws and ethics..\\n\\nThe Sagittarian seeks his goal in expansion and integration and thus combines the fire element with the mobility of his psychic energy..\\n\\nIn so doing, he can sacrifice much for the sake of his ideals..\\n\\nHis mobility is, however, also indicative of changes of opinion..\\n\\nJust as in the Aries phase there is a pure manifestation of the individual himself and, in the phase of Leo, the second fire sign, the expression of the Ego in all its forms, so in the phase of Sagittarius there is a consciousness of this self, this Ego..\\n\\nThe intuitive function type, to which these three signs belong, is represented in the phase of Sagittarius by the man whose insights border on prophecy..\\n\\nThe Sagittarian understands that the thoughts and motivations of human beings form civilization and tries to place his own motives in that setting..\\n\\nThus, in spite of the very personal opinions and subjective \\'truths\\' to which he gives expression, he readily gives an impression of impersonality..\\n\\nA person of the \\'lower\\' Sagittarius type can display a great deal of intolerance together with indiscretion and impatience, but this is a result of unconscious uncertainty towards the newly discovered areas in life..\\n\\nHe stands in contrast here to the more evolved Sagittarian who is, admittedly, always searching out the inner side of things but who is also helped by his more universal vision to pay more heed to the opinions of others..\\n\\nThe mutable fire of the Archer produces an attitude which can best be described as filled with hope and even with a childlike and unconcerned faith in the future..\\n\\nHence, in times of need, he keeps going by being bright and optimistic and by building castles in the air..\\n\\nOn the reverse side of the coin, however, this blind trust is attended by a certain amount of danger..\\n\\nHeedless of warnings and full of zeal, he is inclined to ride roughshod over one and all..\\n\\nThe Sagittarian phase is that of the person who feels himself THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 1 07 to be part of a greater whole transcending the boundaries of home, family and the local community and, full of enthusiasm, accepts the challenge of finding his own place in that greater whole..\\n\\nThis place becomes more definite in the phase of Capricorn..\\n\\nCapricorn - the Sea-goat

they are strong enough to survive the cold of winter..\\n\\nThis is analogous to the stage in the development of the human psyche in which everything is assimilated that was learnt and understood about the wider aspects of life in the Sagittarian phase..\\n\\nIt was on that basis that a new identity was \\'chosen\\' _In this phase, man has a clearly defined notion of what he is, of what he can do and of what he can achieve within the greater social whole..\\n\\nStability of form is important to Capricorn as an earth sign and the outgoing energy of the cardinal cross means that someone of the Capricorn type will engage in giving shape to things..\\n\\nSo we can regard the Capricorn phase as the highest point of the process in which everything is given form..\\n\\nIn the human psyche, this amounts to identification with a certain idea, spiritual or otherwise, while in the social setting the emphasis is laid on the social position as a well-defined whole..\\n\\nActive participation within this whole is no longer one of the aims as it was in the Sagittarian phase where, in the search for the universal principles behind things, no attention was paid to the actual forms under which things presented themselves..\\n\\nIn the Capricorn phas\\U001008c0, attention is however paid to these forms and the main interest lies in the integration of all of them with particular reference to finding one\\'s own position within the greatest possible whole (such as, for instance, in the integrated unit formed by the state)..\\n\\nA sense of personal prowess is quite considerable in Capricorn but, at the same time, this is the most uncertain factor: it is no more than awareness of a self-chosen identity 1 08 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY which has yet to be made good..\\n\\nHere is one of the reasons why it is so important to someone in the Capricorn phase to safeguard his position..\\n\\nAs in the other earth signs, the superior psychic function is that of perception and only practical, concrete and efficient methods receive consideration..\\n\\nSo then, material security is highly valued, although quite differently from the way in which it was prized as a goal in itself during the Taurean phase..\\n\\nIn the phase of Capricorn the need for security stems from a dislike of being dependent that is closely linked with the acquisition of a new-chosen identity..\\n\\nAn individual in the phase of this introvert earth sign, who has to contend with the fact that the way of inner growth is via a clearly mapped inner and outer position, will use his energies in an active manner to achieve this well-planned growth; he will be ambitious and seek status and respec t..\\n\\nTo this end he will rely on perseverance, thrift, discipline, being business-like, integrity and reliability and, in so doing, frequently give the impression of being rather cold and unfeeling..\\n\\nNevertheless, a lot is going on behind his unruffled exterior..\\n\\nJust as in nature there is a struggle to preserve the form which will come to life again in spring, so in the human psyche in the Capricorn phase every effort is made to hold on to forms..\\n\\nSomeone of the Capricorn type runs the risk of tying himself up in the strait-jacket of rules and regulations laid down for the benefit of his new-found order and method..\\n\\nThe struggle for recognition arising from his urge to preserve the formal side of things can make the Goat lonely and melancholy on his ambitious and upward-striving path in life and this may have repercussions on his emotional experience..\\n\\nIt is extremely difficult for somone of a perceptive type like Capricorn to display emotion, since emotion does not belong to the world of tangible and concrete actualities..\\n\\nAccordingly, he will dwell on his feelings for a long time and can find it hard to forget wounding and painful experiences..\\n\\nBecause the Capricorn native is so purposeful, he does not yield to difficulties and is only prepared to give ground if it serves his purpose to do so, regardless of how far in the future his goal may lie..\\n\\nCapricorn patiently endures restrictions, frustrations and difficulties as all these come within the clearly defined framework through which he must pass to his THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 1 09 predetermined objective..\\n\\nAnd so this phase is an obvious reaction to the foregoing one..\\n\\nThe many aims chased by the Archer with such energy have been reduced in the phase of Capricorn to a modest number of practical and achievable long-term goals and the entire life is devoted to making a planned advance towards them..\\n\\nAquarius - the Water-bearer Positive quadruplicity: fixed Element: air Day Ruler: J-t{ Night Ruler: T;, The life of nature is still hidden below ground and, after the struggle for survival has centred on the preservation of form in the Capricorn phase, we see in the Aquarian phase how nature finally disposes of her superfluous forms..\\n\\nEverything that has no more use or has not stood the test is given up..\\n\\nJust as the trees let their dead branches fall at this time -of year (February is the traditional month for gathering wood!), so, in a psychological sense, the form of the Capricorn phase is broken in the phase of Aquarius..\\n\\nBy the use of thought (and Aquarius is an air sign, remember) the personal psyche is submitted to an investigation and is analysed in order to eliminate anything of no use..\\n\\nThis means that, as in the Scorpio phase, someone in the phase of Aquarius undergoes a specific crisis, not now over the depths within his own individuality but over the totality of the human condition..\\n\\nThe need to penetrate to the universal content of the latter was first clearly felt in the Scorpio phase and is finally satisfied in the period of Aquarius by way of a reaction to the fixity of form prized by Capricorn..\\n\\nThis result is due simply to the fact that, in his efforts to break free from forms and to go beyond limits, the Aquarian rises superior to external appearances of things..\\n\\nThe impersonal attitude of Aquarius is a reaction to the strong Ego-sense of Capricorn..\\n\\nThe Aquarian can think objectively without consulting his feelings..\\n\\nHowever, this may mean that he experiences a certain awkwardness in emotional matters..\\n\\nSince his thoughts are sq much in control, his love-life is not very emotional - in appearance anyway..\\n\\nThe fact that Aquarius makes part of the fixed 1 10 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY quadruplicity suggests that someone of the Aquarian type absorbs practically all his experiences, including the emotional ones, and \\'chews them over\\'..\\n\\nThe i\\'n-flowing psychic energy bestows on the Aquarian his great retentiveness of thoughts and ideas..\\n\\nHe has advanced beyond their material and external forms but is still liable to be trapped in the thought-forms of his inner world..\\n\\nOwing to his tenacity, a person of the Aquarian type can prove very faithful, even in love, provided he is given the freedom to hob-nob with friends of both sexes..\\n\\nFriendship, the exchange of thoughts and ideas, and love based on similarity of outlook are found at the core of the Aquarian character..\\n\\nDuring the Capricorn phase man developed into an individual with a place of his own in the greater social whole and now, in the Aquarian phase, he has become a completely socialized entity who feels most at home when in groups and other social settings..\\n\\nHowever, the process which leads to the destruction of forms is not directed against collective forms in the first instance but, because the Aquarian refers everything to himself, to the form in which his own individuality manifests itself..\\n\\nFor one of the Aquarian type, this \\' selfdestruction\\' is indispensable and enables him to place himself within a universal framework and so find himself at the centre of every social relationship..\\n\\nAt times he has to contend with a great deal of personal insecurjty, which he tries to convert into a feeling of security by expressing himself creatively in a collective context..\\n\\nHis way of breaking through fixed boundaries and forms in reaction to the Capricorn phase makes the Aquarian quite literally a citizen of the world..\\n\\nNevertheless, the phase of Aquarius is not devoted to destructiveness as such ; any breaking down is done with the intention of rebuilding..\\n\\nTo return to our analogy, the old branches snap to make way for the new shoots..\\n\\nIn this respect, Aquarius is a regenerating and reforming influence..\\n\\nWithin the social order, Aquarians are seen as eccentric, unconventional, progressive and resourceful , in spite of the fact that their fixed-cross nature can make them hold so tenaciously to their own unconventional ideas and original thinking that the opinions of others are rejected merely because they are not in agreement with the system of ideas they themselves have THE ZODIAC AS A PATH OF LIFE 1 1 1 constructed - even when the latter is contradicted by the facts..\\n\\nThe less developed Aquarian joins in with as many movements as possible because he blindly identifies himself with the ideals and ideas of the group..\\n\\nIn contrast with the solitary eminence of the Capricorn politician, for example, his Aquarian counterpart is more of an egalitarian, and the more evolved Aquarian identifies with humanity at large..\\n\\nOn the other hand, because of his arbitrary and unsophisticated identification with some group, a person of the less advanced type can assist in the promotion of factional antagonisms which work against the u niversalism natural to Aquarius..\\n\\nWhat we then have is the ruthless revolutionary, the direct opposite of the \\' higher\\' Aquarian, who subscribes to a nonpartisan, humanistic and unselfish philosophy of life, based on the mental analysis of what are mainly psychic processes, experiences and events..\\n\\nPisces - the Fish Negative quadruplicity: mutable Element: Water Day ruler: W Night ruler: 1(..\\n\\nX Following an encounter with the human condition in a universalist setting, the universal human condition is experienced within the individual personality..\\n\\nThis transfer from outer to inner can lead to the eventual return of the personality to the primordial state..\\n\\nIn reaction to the Aquarian emphasis on thought, the experience of the Pisces type is purely emotional..\\n\\nAll experiences are very much related to the self but, at the same time, the impersonal element which took shape in the phase of Aquarius retains an influence..\\n\\nThus the Pisces individual has to face the problem of personalizing all occurrences from an impersonal standpoint, striving to amalgamate the universal human experience with the personality..\\n\\nIn its positive form, this attempt is seen as self-denial and compassion and, in its negative form, as a total disintegration of the personality..\\n\\nIn the phase of Aquarius, man becomes master of the process of breaking up old forms in order to build anew..\\n\\nIn the phase of Pisces, this breaking-up process is taken to its logical 1 1 2 PSYCHOLOGICAL ASTROLOGY conclusion in the complete destruction of form, so that the individual in this phase can win mastery over what is formless, that is to say, over the world of thought forms..\\n\\nThe latter, which can still be a stumbling-block for someone of the Aquarius type, undergoes a transformation in the final phase..\\n\\nAs a water sign, Pisces is very sensitive, often emotional and is very impressionable..\\n\\nAlso, as a mutable sign, the Pisces type does not always know what to do with these emotions and consequently falls prey to changes in mood..\\n\\nThe psychic energy flows freely and, in Pisces, the battle is begun between personal and impersonal feelings and experiences..\\n\\nIt is his impersonal side which makes the native often very easy to influence..\\n\\nThis characteristic is especially strong in the less advanced individual to the extent that he is not aware of h is own identity and frequently bears the stamp of the person with whom he was last in contact..\\n\\nThe possibility of reaching a measure of self-detachment, which is a property of the mutable cross, reaches its fullest expression in Pisces, the l ast sign of the zodiac, although this possibility is often beyond the range of vision of a person of the Pisces type..\\n\\nIn the first place, his tuning in with others is not conscious and, being governed by the feelings, he has a great capacity for becoming immersed in the thoughts and feelings of others..\\n\\nHe therefore has a heightened receptivity to images and diffuse sensations (such as atmospheres created or emitted by others) and this helps to promote a capacity for clairvoyance or other forms of extra-sensory perception..\\n\\nDue to this susceptibility to atmosphere and impressions behind the more solid parts of reality, the Pisces native tends to have a mystical cast of mind..\\n\\nWhen the impression endures that there are deeper truths hidden within the external forms of rites and objects, the Pisces individual can become very devout, to the point of slavish adherence to a given doctrine..\\n\\nThe great problem in the Pisces stage is the comprehension of the feelings and the uniting of universal human nature with the personal nature..\\n\\nThis allows the cycle of experience to continue on a higher plane as the person re-enters the phase of Aries with what has been won in the previous cycle..\\n\\nIf the individual is not successful in solving this problem in the development stage of Pisces, it is quite probable that the personality will disintegrate among what C.G. Jung calls the THE ZODIAC AS A PA TH OF LIFE 1 1 3 archetypal contents of the psyche..\\n\\nSuch an individual becomes a prisoner of ideal imagery or vision and even starts to take on its likeness..\\n\\nIn his book Analytical Psychology (see Bibliography), Jung calls this process the identification of the Ego with the collective psyche..\\n\\nSo people of the Pisces type appear to be extremely unstable, an impression which is readily made because, in this stage of psychic development, the individual has already lost essential contact with matter and its forms..\\n\\nThese people are rather impractical, prefer to avoid responsibility on this plane, and are happiest when alone with their thoughts..\\n\\nThey elect to dwell in their private world of dreams and ideals..\\n\\nThe Pisces type likes to work in large collective organizations, in the background if possible (anonymously and behind closed doors) and where his compassion can express itself in helping others, for example in hospitals and similar institutions..\\n\\nOwing to the lively movement of his psychic energy, the emotional Pisces individual has considerable powers of assimilation, but these seldom show to advantage because of his lack of self-confidence, which arises from his great emotional sensitivity..\\n\\nWith this, the last sign Pisces, there is a garnering of the final wisdom, the bringing together of all phenomenal forms into a single unity to which the Pisces individual has access as the destroyer of forms and master of the formless..\\n\\nFormlessness contains the total deposit of all the knowledge and experience gained during the whole cycle of the twelve signs but which is bereft of any form which might detract from its universal character of unity..\\n\\nAnd so the formlessness which is the end result of the twelve-part cycle and is the germ of a new cycle of experience (commencing in the following Aries phase) will enable the past experience to be tested in practice and to receive additions..\\n\\nThe Pisces type, who prepares for the new cycle, can remain unaware of what he is doing yet nevertheless can mature into an individual who has united within himself the two opposites of the personal and impersonal, leaving behind him, so to speak, a field on which new seed may be cast..\\n\\nIn nature too, in the period of the Fish, the ground is ploughed and otherwise prepared for planting and sowing..\\n\\n### Positive and Negative Characteristics of Aries #### Positive Characteristics: 1..\\n\\n**Pioneering** -

    "To make it easy to have a list of celebrities with a particular zodiac sign, it can be easy to just scrape the website AstroCharts. I scraped here the presence of two parts of astrological reason. Next to the sun sign I added the so-called ascendant, which is representing the planet that is ascending at the horizon at the time of birth. They say it represents how the other people perceive the person to be. So it is more what decides the image of the person. It is very possible that characteristics will be generated based on a superficial view of the celebrity. And focusing more on achievements and actions than who the celebrity intrinsically is. If this is true, it might be so that the accuracy score for the ascendant will be higher than for the sun sign. Thank you."

    "It seems that there are many celebrities on the website that are assigned to ascendant but not to a sun sign and the other way around, so merging the two generated data frames would bring many columns without values. It is better to merge the data frames starting from the ascendant table since it has more information and the data from the sun sign table can be mapped on it To make the generating of characteristics and astrological sign not a too time consuming process it is needed to limit the amount of data per astrological sign to 50 for now"

So that was a nice reason for me to save the data so far to a CSV file and see what the predicted and accurate scores were. First, the predicted scores of the data that covers the ARIES sign. That seemed to be quite successful because ARIES was listed on number two with 12 from the 50 predicted ARIES. "
