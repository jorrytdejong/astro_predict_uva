## 14th of May
**Activity:** Exploring various soil health databases to investigate global soil health degeneration.

**Details:** I explored several databases and attempted to visualize data points where soil samples were taken globally.

**Problems Encountered:** None specified.

**Lessons Learned:** Managed to create some visualizations of global soil sample points.

## 15th of May
**Activity:** Formulating a research question based on the soil health dataset.

**Details:** Attempted to create a research question related to cover crops and soil health or tilling and soil health. However, data columns were not linked within the same rows, causing scattered information.

**Problems Encountered:** Data columns were not linked, leading to scattered information.

**Lessons Learned:** Realized that comprehensive databases often contain scattered data, making it difficult to draw conclusions.

## 14th of May
**Activity:** Downloading ArcGIS and exploring GIS for Python.

**Details:** Installed ArcGIS on my MacBook by mirroring a Windows environment and read API documentation for GIS.

**Problems Encountered:** None specified.

**Lessons Learned:** Learned that APIs can make working with complex programs more accessible.

## 25th of May
**Activity:** Shifting focus from soil health databases to generating data with large language models.

**Details:** Became disheartened with soil health databases and decided to generate data using large language models. Explored lang chain and downloaded OLama to use Mistral models locally.

**Problems Encountered:** Needed to pay for OpenAI API or OLama hosting, but found my computer could handle local models.

**Lessons Learned:** Persistence in searching for solutions pays off; found a way to use Mistral large language model locally.

## 26th of May
**Activity:** Scraping astrological websites.

**Details:** Scraped data smoothly from a website with a simple HTML structure.

**Problems Encountered:** None.

**Lessons Learned:** Simple HTML structures make data scraping straightforward.

## 27th of May
**Activity:** Lang chain and prompt engineering.

**Details:** Experimented with lang chain and prompt engineering to create contextual prompts.

**Problems Encountered:** Confusion with the use of square brackets and parentheses, resulting in errors.

**Lessons Learned:** Despite the randomness of the library's syntax, persistence led to streamlined functionality.

## 28th of May
**Activity:** Generating texts for celebrities and studying astrology.

**Details:** Engineered prompts for generating interesting texts and studied astrology PDFs for better prediction accuracy.

**Problems Encountered:** Continued confusion with brackets and parentheses.

**Lessons Learned:** Improved intuition for astrology predictions and better prompt engineering.

## 30th of May
**Activity:** Running the full code on CSV data.

**Details:** Executed the entire code on all CSV data, facing long running times.

**Problems Encountered:** Long running times and the need for uninterrupted computer operation.

**Lessons Learned:** Practical problems such as planning and time management are crucial in executing experiments in notebooks.
