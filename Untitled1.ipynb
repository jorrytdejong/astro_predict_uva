    "# Astrology Verification via Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook introduces an innovative project aimed at testing the validity of astrology. The project involves the use of a language model to analyze the biographies of people born on specific dates, corresponding to each astrological sign, and summarizing their characteristics. These summaries are then used to see if a certain astrological sign could be assigned based on the identified characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The individuals are selected based on their birth date and their fame, ensuring a rich biography for the language model to process. The summaries generated by the language model serve as a character analysis based on the individuals' biographies. The language model is then tasked to assign an astrological sign to each person based on these summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying assumptions are that the character analysis based on the biography is accurate and that the correct astrological sign can be determined from these characteristics. This approach offers an intriguing way to examine the claims of astrology through the lens of data analysis and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biographies will be processed through a local Large Language Model, or Ollama. This tool will assign astrology signs, assuming the model has absorbed enough modern astrological information to make similar conclusions about people as typically done in astrology.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will create a data file by randomly selecting a certain number of renowned individuals born at the midpoint of an astrological sign. This ensures that the characteristics of the specific sign are at their strongest. We will retrieve the names of these individuals, along with the Wikipedia links to their biographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will automatically scrape all the biographies into a CSV or SQL file. This will result in a table containing birthdates, names, and biographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterward, the OLAMA model will extract characteristics from this data. We will ensure the few-shot prompt functions correctly and verify that it provides the required results."
