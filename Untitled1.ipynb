    "# Astrology Verification via Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook introduces an innovative project aimed at testing the validity of astrology. The project involves the use of a language model to analyze the biographies of people born on specific dates, corresponding to each astrological sign, and summarizing their characteristics. These summaries are then used to see if a certain astrological sign could be assigned based on the identified characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The individuals are selected based on their birth date and their fame, ensuring a rich biography for the language model to process. The summaries generated by the language model serve as a character analysis based on the individuals' biographies. The language model is then tasked to assign an astrological sign to each person based on these summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying assumptions are that the character analysis based on the biography is accurate and that the correct astrological sign can be determined from these characteristics. This approach offers an intriguing way to examine the claims of astrology through the lens of data analysis and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biographies will be processed through a local Large Language Model, or Ollama. This tool will assign astrology signs, assuming the model has absorbed enough modern astrological information to make similar conclusions about people as typically done in astrology.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will create a data file by randomly selecting a certain number of renowned individuals born at the midpoint of an astrological sign. This ensures that the characteristics of the specific sign are at their strongest. We will retrieve the names of these individuals, along with the Wikipedia links to their biographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will automatically scrape all the biographies into a CSV or SQL file. This will result in a table containing birthdates, names, and biographies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterward, the OLAMA model will extract characteristics from this data. We will ensure the few-shot prompt functions correctly and verify that it provides the required results."

    "In this section, we'll loop through the biographies and use them as context for deriving personal information. If there's a 'Personal Life' section available in the Wikipedia page, we'll just take this section. Otherwise, we'll use the whole biography. The derived personal information will be inputted into the OLAMA() function, resulting in a list of short characteristics for each individual."

    "So, lets use it now to see if it can generate a astrological analysis, based on the knowledge of astrology that the language model might have. To test it, let's first read an astrological analysis of two to three people, their short biography and then the astrological sign in which they were born. Then we put their biographies as input, we let the model behave like an astrologer, and then see if we end up having the same conclusion. We ask the model to give a reason for why it chose what it chose. "

      "part1  Donald Trump, as a public figure, can be analyzed based on his actions, speeches, policies, and personal behaviors during his tenure as President of the United States (2017-2021) and before that in his business career. It is important to remember that interpretations of personality and motivations can vary greatly, especially when dealing with high-profile individuals like Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Motivations:**\n",
      "1. **Power and Wealth**: Trump has consistently expressed a desire for power and wealth throughout his career. This motivation can be seen in his business ventures, political campaigns, and time in the White House. He often emphasized making \"America Great Again\" as a means to increase U.S. power and influence on the global stage.\n",
      "2. **Recognition and Admiration**: Trump seems to be driven by a need for recognition and admiration. He often seeks validation through media attention, social media engagement, and poll numbers. This motivation can be both healthy (a drive to succeed) and unhealthy (an obsession with image and public opinion).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Values:**\n",
      "1. **Nationalism**: Trump's \"America First\" policy reflects a strong belief in nationalism, prioritizing the interests of American citizens and businesses over international cooperation. This can be seen as both healthy (prioritizing domestic concerns) and unhealthy (isolationist tendencies).\n",
      "2. **Economic Growth**: Trump has consistently emphasized economic growth and job creation, often focusing on policies that support business development and tax cuts. This value can contribute to a strong economy but may also lead to income inequality if not balanced with social welfare considerations.\n",
      "3. **Self-Reliance**: Trump's rhetoric often encourages self-reliance and independence among Americans, emphasizing individual responsibility over collective action or government support. This can be healthy (encouraging personal growth and initiative) but may also exacerbate societal issues like poverty and inequality if not paired with adequate safety nets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Behaviors:**\n",
      "1. **Direct Communication**: Trump's communication style is often direct, blunt, and unfiltered. This can be interpreted as honest and transparent, but it can also lead to conflicts, as his words are sometimes perceived as harsh or offensive.\n",
      "2. **Conflict and Confrontation**: Trump tends to engage in conflict and confrontation, both personally and politically. This behavior can be seen as assertive (a positive trait when used appropriately) but can also escalate tensions and lead to divisiveness.\n",
      "3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Despite a reputation for inflexibility, Trump has shown an ability to adapt his positions on issues based on feedback or changing circumstances. This can be seen as both healthy (responsive leadership) and unhealthy (flip-flopping or inconsistency).\n",
      "4. **Relationship Management**: Trump's relationships with other leaders have been varied, often characterized by a transactional approach to diplomacy rather than traditional alliance-building. This behavior can lead to both productive outcomes (negotiations resulting in agreements) and negative consequences (strained international relations).\n",
      "part2  This individual is driven by a desire for power and wealth, as well as recognition and admiration. They prioritize national interests over international cooperation (nationalist) while promoting economic growth and job creation. Self-reliance and independence are encouraged, with direct communication being a hallmark of their style. This person may engage in conflict and confrontation, demonstrating adaptability in certain situations but potentially creating divisiveness. Their relationship management style is transactional, often resulting in a mix of productive outcomes and strained international relations.\n",
