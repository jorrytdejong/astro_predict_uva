    "This Jupyter notebook aims to find a possible argument for the validity of astrology. This is done by retrieving the characteristics of a few hundred celebrities and assigning the right zodiac sign to them based on their characteristics. If the accuracy score is already higher than 1 divided by 12, it is not invalid to say that astrology might not be complete. Initially, I sought to generate the characteristics of the celebrities based on their Wikipedia pages and looping through them by retrieving the links of their Wikipedia pages via Sparkle. I only found out that a more concise summary of the life of a celebrity can be given by just inputting the right prompt in a language model. Since the language models that are now freely available on the market have been trained on billions of internet pages that are often covering celebrities, the information that comes out of the model is very accurate and with right prompting it can also be tweaked to represent more the characteristics of the celebrity rather than the activities and achievements that he or she has made."

    "The first step of building this code is by making some effective prompts. To receive the output from the language model that we want. The language model that is used is Mistral-7B. It is a relatively small model of around 4 GB that is allegedly better than the Facebook-made Llama model of even a bigger amount of parameters. Since it is quite expensive to run a language model for hours, not only because you pay for the usage of the language model, but also for the GPU that is needed for it. This model was attractive since it could just run on my M2 chip of my MacBook and it still was generating the information that was needed to make this analysis."

When we ask a language model explicitly about the characteristics of person X, unavoidably the name of X will be used in the answer as well as activities and achievements that are exemplary and can be used to easily trace down the output to the inputted person. This will be bad for the purpose of this code since it might bias the outcome by already giving the right astrological sign in the output since there are many internet articles making astrological analysis about celebrities and we would miss the blindfoldedness of the code that we wish to have in order to see if we can really assign the right astrological sign to the celebrity with which we actually would predict the time frame in which a person is born by the sheer characteristics of him.

We import a few classes from the  Langchain Library for this and make connection with a local Mistral language model. One thing about the Langchain library is that it uses some specific method of combining multiple elements that are needed to create the output. And that is a method called chaining, where in an intuitive way the different elements are just put together on one line with a vertical dash between them. And it gets combined in a code that functions as a chain. "

Here comes the first difficulty of our approach and that is that if the web is stuffed with information that is mostly about actions and achievements and less about the internal qualities and deficiencies of the person described.

His focus on stability may cause him to prioritize maintaining the status quo over enacting meaningful change, which could be seen as uninspiring or stagnant by some members of the public. Furthermore, his tendency to avoid confrontation and compromise too easily might lead to missed opportunities for progress in certain areas.\n"

And then of course that cell didn't go. Then I stopped that cell that was about to print the data frame, but then the data frame that was in process was stopped too. So that was a nice reason for me to save the data so far to a CSV file and see what the predicted and accurate scores were. First, the predicted scores of the data that covers the ARIES sign. That seemed to be quite successful because ARIES was listed on number two with 12 from the 50 predicted ARIES. "

It is mostly about the actions and the part about the negative sizes. They all seem very assertive people which is of course also the case with celebrities.
